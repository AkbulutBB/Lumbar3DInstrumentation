Overview
This repository contains the 3D printing files and documentation for creating a cost-effective, fluoroscopy-compatible L4-L5 spine model for pedicle screw placement training. The model features innovative use of barium-enhanced coating and PETG material, providing both structural integrity and radiographic visibility at a fraction of the cost of commercial alternatives.
